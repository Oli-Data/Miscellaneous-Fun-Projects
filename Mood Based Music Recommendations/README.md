# Oli's Mood-Based Music Recommender ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to a simple project made to match music to your mood â€” whether youâ€™re vibing, venting, or just trying to romanticize your life a little.

You choose the mood. It gives you music. Thatâ€™s it.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

This is a command-line Python script that asks how you feel and returns a list of songs based on your vibe. Moods included:

- Happy
- Sad
- Chill
- Angry
- Romantic

Each mood has a curated list of 5 songs â€” not basic top 40 stuff either. These are handpicked tracks with real personality.
